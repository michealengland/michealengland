ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Mike England, a software engineer focused on building scalable web applications and intuitive user experiences. I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and React, with experience leading teams and delivering high-quality products.

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy creating mini projects that demonstrate real-world engineering skills with a fast turnaround. Right now, Iâ€™m working on Mini Spendy, a budget-tracking app in React Native.
ðŸš— When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m at the track drifting my 350z that I built.
ðŸ“¬ Letâ€™s connect!

## [micheal.dev](https://micheal.dev)

My personal site and portfolio, built with Astro JS and Tailwind CSS. Showcases my projects, blog posts, and experiments.

## [Stellar Pages](https://stellarpages.app)

Stellar Pages merges my passion for Markdown with my design background. Originally an Electron app, this privacy-focused web application lets users transform Markdown documents into beautiful, stylized PDFs.

Built with:

- Astro JS
- Tailwind CSS
- IndexedDB

## [DSA Flashcards](https://github.com/michealengland/dsa-flashcards)

A simple multiple-choice CLI flashcard system for learning DSA concepts. Built with Node.js, featuring spaced repetition and custom decks. I wanted to refresh my data structures & algorithms knowledge, so I built this as a quick, fun side project while working through [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine/).

## [Mini Spendy] (WIP)

A React Native budget planner app to track expenses and manage monthly/yearly budgets.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript focused Front End Engineer, in Dayton, Ohio. So what does "JavaScript focused" mean? I work on a variety of projects using: JavaScript, React, Webpack, Jest, Gutenberg blocks, Gatsby, and Next.js.

## What I'm working on...

In my free time I'm passionate about working on side projects. Here are a few of my favorite code experiments:

<details>
<summary>Timeline App</summary>

Okay, so the name isn't so original ðŸ˜„. Timeline App is a simple social app for creating and organizing timelines. Each timeline consists of posts, and each post must have a title, date, and associated timeline. Unlike most social apps, the idea here is that your timeline is a reflection of your life. Users can modify post dates, relocate posts to other timelines and have as many timelines as they like. Under the hood, this PWA is powered by Firebase and React.

<summary>Image Sorcery</summary>

While working on the Timeline App it became clear that I had an image size problem. While users can add and upload images to posts, they cannot resize or manipulate images. This problem contributes to excessive storage sizes and a poor user experience with creating new posts. Thus the idea for "Image Sorcery" was born.

Image Sorcery is a client side image editing UI for the browser. Behind the scenes this app uses [JIMP (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) to manipulate the image data directly in the browser. While there are many 3rd party solutions for handling image manipulation, I wanted to create something fun and cost-effective that doesn't require a 3rd party solution.

Eventually, I plan to make this Image Sorcery an NPM package.

<summary>Display Exif Data</summary>

Display Exif Data is a WordPress plugin that enables content creators to display exif data on images. Rather than provide another "custom block" for users to manage, this plugin attaches additional controls directly into the `core/image` block. This way users can decide at the block level which images they want to display exif data on. Optionally, site-admins can pick and choose which fields they want to allow and if the field choices can be overridden at the block level. Eventually, I plan to extend the functionality to more blocks such as the "Gallery" block.

<summary>micheal.dev</summary>

At the end of 2020, I decided it's time to refocus my personal site [micheal.dev](https://micheal.dev) with the latest techniques I've learned over the last two years. My current site is a simple static site built using Gatsby. This time around, I enforced more strict coding standards, re-imagined styling, refactored all of the components, and integrated Jest for testing my code. Also, this site is open source. My goal is to continuously add new features and create a scalable platform to grow alongside my career.

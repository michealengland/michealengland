## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript focused Frontend Engineer, in Dayton, Ohio. So what does "JavaScript focused" mean? I work with a variety of project types including: React, Webpack, Jest, Gutenberg blocks, Gatsby & and Next.js.

## What I'm working on...

In my free time I'm passionate about working on side projects. Currently, I have a few that I would love to share!

### Timeline App (WIP)

<details>
<summary>Timeline App (WIP)</summary>
Okay, so the name isn't so original ðŸ˜„. Timeline App is a simple social app for creating posts based on a date range. There are no rules for posts other than it must have a title and a date. Users can change post dates, relocate posts to other timelines and have as many timelines as they like. Powered by Firebase and React, this project is one of my favorite learning projects!

### Image Sorcery (WIP)

While working on the Timeline App it became clear that I had an image size problem. Image Sorcery is a client side image manipulation tool in the browser powered by [JIMP (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp). My goal for this project is to create a lightweight image editing UI in the browser. This UI will allow users to edit, crop, and enhance images before uploading the newly created file somewhere.

### Display Exif Data WordPress Plugin

Display Exif Data is a WordPress plugin for allowing users to display image data in WordPress. When I created this project, I didn't want to provide another "custom block" for users to worry about. Instead this plugin filters existing `core/image` block settings to enable display of custom exif data fields. This includes a custom settings page for customizing what exif data settings are allowed and if they can be adjusted at the block level.

### Personal Site & Growth

At the end of 2020, I decided it's time to refocus my personal site [micheal.dev](https://micheal.dev) with all of the latest practices I've learned over the last two years. My current site is a simple static site built using Gatsby. This time around, I enforced more strict coding standards, re-imagined styling, refactored all of the components, and integrated Jest for testing my code.

## âš¡ Fun Fact:

I'm a doberman dad, cat father, and soon to be Dad. When I'm not coding, I'm riding motorcycles, modding my car, or binging the latest zombie shows on Netflix.
